Fourteen years ago Attila and Marion Glatz, founders and producers of Salute to Vienna, realized their dream of bringing the joy and beauty of Vienna's Neujahrskonzert to North American audiences. Salute to Vienna, premiered at Toronto's Roy Thomson Hall in 1995 and was an immediate success. Beginning with that first sold-out performance, Salute to Vienna has grown to become the largest simultaneously produced concert series in North America. This year Salute to Vienna audiences in 20 major North American cities will celebrate the New Year in traditional Viennese style!  New York to L.A. /Vancouver to Montreal.
Guided by their own musical passion and commitment to artistic excellence and authenticity, producers Attila and Marion Glatz travel several times each year to the City of Dreams (Vienna) and other major cultural centers around the globe, to carefully select some of the most dynamic talent from the best of Europe's opera houses and concert halls. Each international cast of maestros, singers and dancers is backed by a full symphony orchestra, and performs the glorious Viennese music, song and dance in dazzling splendor!  Audiences are always cheered by the light-hearted, yet subtly profound character of the music:  operatic excerpts, arias, waltzes and polkas (always a few surprises of course), courtesy of Johann Strauss Jr., Vienna's beloved “Waltz King”..
Encouraged by their initial success at Toronto's Roy Thomson Hall, one year later, in 1996, another sold-out  concert debuted at New York's Lincoln Center. The rest is Salute to Vienna history! Attila and Marion Glatz steadily expanded their renowned production to include North America's most prestigious, major cultural centers. Now, over 50 thousand people can experience a live festive Neujahrskonzert without going all the way to Vienna, or watching it on television! For this remarkable achievement, Attila and Marion Glatz were awarded the Austrian Government's prestigious Decoration of Merit in Gold.
Salute to Vienna is now one of  North America's favourite New Year's traditions. What Nutcracker means to Christmas, Salute to Vienna means to the New Year!","https://www.usaustrians.com/assets/dynamic_image/bus_logo/cae_logo_81_6606.jpg",,"https://www.usaustrians.com/Austrian-enterprises-inUSA/6606/attila-glatz-concerts-productions-inc"

In little over twenty years, principal Christoph Kapeller, AIA has developed design and building expertise in places as diverse as Norway, Europe, Egypt and the United States. The work of firm principal Christoph Kapeller, AIA, has been widely recognized for its iconic power and capacity to provide profound spatial experiences. In the words of architecture critic Richard Ingersoll, the new library in Alexandria, Egypt, designed and implemented by Christoph Kapeller (in his capacity as founding partner of Snøhetta and project director for the Bibliotheca Alexandrina) is “ingeniously planned and impeccably assembled”.sCK-Architecture is a design oriented firm of relatively small size that benefits their clients by guaranteeing intensive participation of the founding principal in all stages of the work with the capacity to accomplish the results of much larger firms through strategic alliances developed during twenty years of practice. It is CK-Architecture's expressed mission to define architecture as a vehicle that delivers world-class design solutions that fully satisfy the client's aspirations and founded on the beliefs that the attitude, experience and attention brought to each design challenge is equally important regardless of its scope, and more importantly, that the solution should be equally satisfying at humanistic, functional, technical and economic levels.sCK-Architecture's has extensive experience in design within campus contexts during recent years, including the newly completed Robert H. Timme FAIA Graduate Research Center at the USC School of Architecture that has been unanimously admired by university stakeholders, students and architecture faculty alike. Despite the firm's extensive experience with research libraries, CK-Architecture has chosen not to specialize in any one specific building type. The firm has been engaged in numerous projects at pre-design and programming stages and has successfully assisted fundraising efforts.sAt the urban scale, CK-Architecture's efforts benefit from the multi-cultural experience of Christoph Kapeller in Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East and the United States. CK-Architecture advocates for a multi-disciplinary urban design approach in collaborations including planners, landscape architects, artists, sustainability engineers and other specialty consultants.","https://www.usaustrians.com/assets/dynamic_image/bus_logo/cae_logo_81_9397.jpg","[""http://bit.ly/8cl.Kzf"",""CKArchitecture1""]","https://www.usaustrians.com/Austrian-enterprises-inUSA/9397/ckarchitecture"

As the reigning Eurobowl XXIII champion they are the best team in Europe. The Tyroleans also won the Eurobowl – Europe's Champions League of American football – in 2008. They also won the Austrian Bowl in 2006 and 2004 as well as the EFAF Cup in 2004.On the 15th of September 1992, the birthday of the Raiders, a group of “greenhorns” met for the first time. After months of preparations they founded an American football team. In 1993 they played as the Papa Joe's Raiders West in the third division. The team did not experience a single loss. In the same year, the Raiders were named “Newcomer Team of the Year 1993.” With this success, the Raiders were given the opportunity to ascend into the second division. Through the ascension into the First Division and the incredible efforts of the previous year, the Raiders were now playing in the highest Football League in Austria. Using more import players the Raiders won seven of eight games in the 2000 regular season and also beat the Klagenfurt Cowboys in the playoffs. But they lost 28-34 to the Chrysler Vikings in their very first trip to the Austrian Bowl.In 2004 the Raiders finally won their first titles. They defeated the Chrysler Vikings 28-20 in the Austrian Bowl. They also won the EFAF Cup, crushing the P.A. Farnham Knights from the United Kingdom 45-0. In 2006 the Swarco Holding Wattens became the new main sponsor for the team, which changed its name to SWARCO Raiders Tirol. The Raiders won the national championship that season, beating the Dodge Vikings Vienna 43-19 in Austrian Bowl XXII.On July 5, 2008, the Raiders experienced their biggest success in team history. In an exciting showdown, they defeated the Raiffeisen Vikings 28-24 to win Eurobowl XXII. It was the team's first Eurobowl championship. The team's new marketing teammate followed every step that year as The Oakland Raiders started a cooperation with the SWARCO Raiders in the spring of 2008. This partnership is a great opportunity for the Raiders to make American football in Austria more popular. Both teams feature articles on each others' official websites on a regular basis. In 2009 the web show „Beyond The Field – American Football The Austrian Way“ went online. And SWARCO Raiders coaches were given the opportunity to join the Oakland Raiders' training camp.In 2009 the SWARCO Raiders were able to defend their Eurobowl title. In front of an Austrian record 6,500 fans, they beat Flash de La Courneuve (France) 30-19. Another 2,000 people were following the game online at http://www.raiderstv.at.After they lost in the 2010 Austrian Bowl and fell short of reaching a third straight Eurobowl final the team decided to move into a new direction, hiring German native Shuan Fatah as their new head coach. Fatah led the team to its first double, winning the Eurobowl and the Austrian Bowl in 2011. A combined 18,200 people were watching the two finals live. And almost 80,000 fans worldwide followed the SWARCO Raiders games live online.
