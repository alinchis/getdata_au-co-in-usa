  "description": "GEIGER “NaturWalk” says it all! Our knitted fabrics are cunningly felted honoring traditional methods of the alpine region. This highly innovative process - developed by GEIGER's own technicians – uses only warm water, heat and motion and eliminates the need for harmful chemicals. This assures that our land, air and water stays unpolluted. Furthermore this technique saves 90% of the energy and resources used in conventionalmethods.",
